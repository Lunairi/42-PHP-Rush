# 42-PHP-Rush-00

First web project for 42 piscine PHP, a two week crash course on learning PHP. Partnered with Justin Chow aka Kraxx who handled the front end, while I handled back end. PHP was rigorously used along with session to create a very smooth experience and easy to edit and change setup for an admin account. 

Important concepts here was learning to database (which was handled in this project due to time limit through file serialization), sessions to allow account and information parsing/functionality, ability to add/remove product and be able to create as much of a mock ecommerce site through PHP, HTML and CSS.

Use install.php first before running the website to install all database and admin account. MySQL not used, instead a file serialization is used instead.
